Let the reader be introduced to Lady Carbury , when she wants to find her own room in her own room in her own house in Welbeck Street . Let the reader tells her that she does not want to read the reader to Lady Carbury .
Something of the nature of her devotion may be written with a long running hand , by the perusal of three letters which had written in the morning .
She was the daughter of Patrick Carbury and Patrick Carbury , who had done great things as a soldier in the Republic of India , and had been a baronet .
From all this it had come to pass that dabbling in literature which was partly perhaps from a sense of pleasure in the work . This was partly as a passport into society , it had been changed into hard work by which money if possible .
Lady Carbury 's house in Welbeck Street was a modest house enough to be a mansion , hardly assuming even to be a home .

On such an afternoon , if ever , the Lord High Chancellor ought to be sitting here , if he is sitting here he is a foggy glory round his head , softly fenced in with crimson cloth and curtains , addressed with great whiskers , a little voice , and where he can see nothing butog .
On such afternoon some score of members of the High Court of Chancery bar ought to be Solomonas here they are engaged in one of the ten thousand stages of an endless cause , tripping one another up on slippery precedents and making a pretence of equity with serious faces , and horsehair ward and heads against walls of words , making a pretence of serious faces as might .

Mr. Bennet was one of the first people to marry Mr. Bingley 's wife .

Not all that Mrs. Bennet , however , had the help of her five daughters , could ask on the subject . She was not able to draw from her husband 's description of Mr. Bingley .

In another moment down went Alice after it , she never thought how in the world she was to get back again .
After that , the rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way , so Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well .
Either the well was very deep , or she fell very slowly . She went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next .
First , she tried to look down and make out what she came to , but she was too dark to see anything . However , she looked at the sides of the well , and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves , here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs .
She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed . However , she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath , so she was able to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it .

There came through the open door of the heavy door of the lilac . When the light summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden , there came through the open door of the heavy door of the lilac , or the color of perfume of the pink-flowering thorn .
From the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he was lying , as was his custom , innumerable cigarettes , Lord Henry Wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured blossoms of a laburnum , whose tremulous branches of birds seemed hardly able to bear the burden of a beauty so-like flames .
The sullen murmurmur of the bees shoulder their way through the long unmown grass , or circling with round the gilt horns of the straggling woodbine , seemed to make the stillness more oppressive .
The dim roar of London was the main part of the bourdon note of a distant organ .
In the centre of the room , clamped to an upright easel , stood the full-length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty , and in front of it , some little distance away , was sitting the artist himself , the artist himself , Basil Hallward , whose sudden disappearance some years ago caused , at the time .
One morning , when the Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams , he found himself in his bed into a horrible vermin .
He lay on his armour-like back . However , if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly , he was divided by the arches into the stiff parts .
However , the bedding was hardly able to cover it and could slide off any moment .
His many legs , called pitifully compared with the size of the rest of him , about helplessly as he looked .
What happened to me ? He thought he thought was very good .
Because of this , hot evening early in July a young man came out of the garret in which he went slowly in S . Place and went slowly as though in hesitation , towards K bridge .
He did not like this meeting his landlady on the staircase .
His garret was under the roof of a high house , five-storied house and more like a cupboard than a room .
The landlady who provided him with garret , dinners , and attendance , lived on the floor below . Every time he went out he was given a place to pass her kitchen , the door of which he stood open .
And each time he passed , the young man had a sick feeling , which made him feeling and feel ashamed .
He said that he was in debt to his landlady . He was afraid of meeting her .
This was not because he was cowardly and abject , quite the opposite of a person ; but for some time past he had been in an overstrained irritable condition .
He had become so completely taken away in himself , and found out that he did not like any landlady , but anyone at all .
He was crushed by poverty . However , the anxieties of his position were not allowed to weigh upon him .
This evening , however , on coming out into the street , he became aware of his fears .
In this case , a plump Mulligan came from the stairhead , with a bowl of lather on which a razor was crossed .
He was a yellow dressinggown , ungirdled , and had a gently behind him in the morning air .
Introibo held the bowl aloft and held the altar for Dei .
Halted , he made up the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely :
Come up , a song about Kinch ! Come up , is a jesuit !
Solemnly started playing the round gunrest in a round gun .
He went to the tower and went to the top of the tower , the surrounding land and the awaking mountains .
He then saw Stephen Dedalus and made rapid crosses in the air . He said that he had been able to see in his throat and shaking his head .
Stephen Dedalus , displeased and sleepy , leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the top of the gurgling face that blessed him , equine in its length , and at the light hair , grained like pale oak .
Buck Mulligan covered an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly .
It is a melancholy object to those , who walk through this great town , or travel in the country . Because of this , they see the streets , the roads , and cabbin-doors crowded with beggars of the female sex , followed by three , four , six children , all in rags .
These mothers , instead of being able to work for their honest livelihood , are forced to be able to use all their time in strolling to beg sustenance for their helpless infants , as they grow up , either turn thieves for want of work , or leave their native country to Spain , or sell themselves to the Barbadoes .
But my intention is very far from being taken from being confined to provide only for the children of professed beggars : it is of a much greater extent , and shall take in the whole number of infants at a certain age , who are born of parents as little able to support them .
As to my own part , having turned my thoughts for many years after this important subject , I have always found them that they would be mistaken in their computation . I have always found them in their computation .
Because of this , I again subtract fifty thousand people , for those women who have children die in the year .
There only remain a hundred and twenty thousand children of poor parents every year .
Because of this , I shall now think my own thoughts , which I hope will not be liable to the least objection .
I have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London , that a young healthy child well nursed , is , at a year old nourishing and wholesome food , whether stewed , roasted , baked , or boiled . I make no doubt that it will serve in a fricasee , or a ragoust .
That the remaining hundred thousand may , at a year old , be offered in sale to the persons of quality and fortune , through the kingdom . In the last month , she tells the mother to let them make a good table , so the last month , so they want to make them plump .
A child will make two dishes at an entertainment for friends . When the family dines alone , the fore or fore will make a reasonable dish , and seasoned with a little pepper or salt , will be very good boiled on the fourth day .
Mr. Mr. Mr. Mr. Utterson 's lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance that was never lighted by a smile ; cold , scanty and embarrassed in discourse ; backward in sentiment ; lean , long , dreary .
At friendly meetings , and when the wine was to his taste , the human beaconed from his eye ; something indeed which never found its way into his talk . However , this was not only seen in these silent symbols of the after-dinner face , but more often found his life .
He was austere with himself . When he was alone he was alone , he had not crossed the doors of one for twenty years , but he had not crossed the doors of one for twenty years .
But he had an approved tolerance for others ; sometimes wondering , at the high pressure of spirits involved in their misdeeds . This was because they did not want to help rather than to reprove .
He used to say that he had been given a lot of money , but in his own way , he used to say : he let my brother go to the devil in his own way style .
In this character , it was often called the last good acquaintance and the last good influence in the lives of downgoing men .
He did not like these , so they came about his chambers . He never became a shade of change in his demeanour .
However , the feat was easy to Mr. Utterson ; for he was undemonstrative at the best , and even his friendship seemed to be started at the same time as the catholicity of good-nature .
It is the mark of a modest man to make up his friendly circle ready-made from the hands of opportunity ; and that was a member of the group .
His friends were those of his own blood or those who he had known the longest . His friends did not like ivy , because they thought they did not know no aptness in the object .
My father is known for being Pirrip , and my Christian name Philip could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit than Pip .
So , he called the myself Pip , and it was called Pip .
I give Pirrip as my father 's family name , but Joe Gargery married the blacksmith , and I give Pirrip as my father . He also had a sister called the '' Blacksmith '' .
Because I never saw my father or my mother , and never saw any likeness of either of them ( for their days were long before the days of photographs ) , my first fancies about what they were like tombstones .
He gave me an odd idea that he was a square , stout , dark man , and curly black hair , and had the shape of the letters .
From the character and turn of the inscription , the Georgiana Wife of the Above , he said that my mother was freckled and sickly , and that her mother was sick .
To five little stone lozenges , each about a foot and a half long , which were arranged in a neat row beside their grave beside their grave , and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of mine , gangwho gave up trying to get a living in their backs with their hands in their belief I religiously entertained that they had all been born on their backs with their hands .
In the past , Ours was the marsh country , down by the river , within the river , as well as the river wound .
My first started using the identity of things seems to me to have been gained on a raw afternoon towards evening .
At such a time I found out for certain that this bleak place overgrown with nettles was the churchyard ; and that Philip Pirrip , late of this parish , and also Georgiana wife of the above , were dead and buried ; and that Alexander , Bartholomew , Abraham , Tobias , and Roger , were also dead and buried in the sea where they had been buried , and had a large amount of wilderness .
