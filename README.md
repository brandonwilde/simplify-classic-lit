# simplify-classic-lit: Evaluating ATS performance on classic literature
Authors: Brandon Wilde and Melissa Lopez

This repository contains data and scripts used for a Spring 2022 term project in which we evaluated
the performance of [ACCESS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/access/tree/main/access) 
and [MUSS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/muss/tree/main/muss) on a corpus we created 
using passages from classic literature retrieved from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/). 
Evaluation metrics were collected using [EASSE](https://github.com/feralvam/easse) and a sentence-level cosine 
similarity script, and they were compared with human quality ratings.
